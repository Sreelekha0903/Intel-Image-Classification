# Intel-Image-Classification
Trained and classified 25000 images using neural networks via keras (tensorflow).
Added convolutional and max pooling layers with RELU activation to reduce the image size
Created dense layers with RELU and Softmax activation functions.
Added a callback method to cancel training when the validation set accuracy reached 80%.
Plotted training-validation accuracy and loss plots to verify if there is any overfitting or underfitting issue.
